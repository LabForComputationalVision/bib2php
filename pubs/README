bib2php creates a PHP page from a BibTeX file.  It creates a main page that can
be sorted by year, document type or first author, and can be filtered by 
document type.  It also creates an abstract page with more information about 
each document.  You can add information like links to related and superseded 
documents with the use of a bibaux file that uses syntax similar to a BibTeX 
file.
You can see an example of it in use at:

To install bib2php just unpack the tar file in a directory that your webserver
can see and change the following entries in pubs/bib2php.conf:
  + you probably want to set caching to 'off' at least initially.  If you turn
    it on you'll need to set the directory where the cached files are saved in
    'cacheloc'.
  + bibtex - file and path to your bibtex file
  + aux - file and path to your bibaux file
  + abstract - location for abstract files. File names are expected to be 
    key-abstract.suffix.  Key is the bibtex key for the document and suffix is 
either txt or html.
  + pdf - base URL of directory containing all PDF files.
  + base1 - change this to the URL where you placed publications.php
  + lcvheader - change to 'off'

## Here's a description of the files in bib2php
Top directory
+ publications.php - This is the file that generates the publications page.
  It does this based on the user's radio button and check box selections.  It 
  creates the links at the top of the page based on the sort method and then 
  includes the appropriate page from pubs/CACHE.

Subdirectory (hardcoded as pubs/)
+ authorURL.txt - File that contains the mapping from author names to URLs.
+ bib2php.conf - configuration file that defines the following variables:
  BIBTEX - The name of the bibtex file to use.
  AUX - The name of the auxiliary file to use.
  ABSTRACT - Directory that contains the publication abstracts.
  AUTHOR - File that contains the mapping from author names to URLs.
  JOURNAL - File that contains the mapping from journal names to URLs.
  BASE1 - The base URL that the publications will be located at.
  The variables BIBTEX, AUX, ABSTRACT, AUTHOR, and JOURNAL are assumed to be 
  in the subdirectory pub/.
+ freshenPubs.php - PHP script that updates cached versions of publication 
  pages stored in pubs/CACHE.
+ journalURL.txt - File that contains the mapping from journal names to URLs.
+ lcvheader_dynamic.html - Code used to create the LCV header with selection 
  boxes.
+ makeAbs.php - This file generates the abstract pages dynamically.
+ simoncelli.aux - auxiliary file.  More information on the format of the 
  auxiliary file can be found in aux-documentation.txt.
+ simoncelli.bib - bibtex file
+ URLchecker_nopass.php - php script that checks for broken links in the 
  publications page and each of the abstract pages.  The page publications.php 
  contains code at the bottom that can be uncommented to reveal a button that 
  triggers this script.
+ bib2php.log - Log file that stores the number of times each combination of 
  of sort method and exclusion check boxes is selected.  The file contains a 
  raw list of numbers.  The table below tells the mapping of index to included 
  page:
